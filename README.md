# Decompiling the Syngergy Study
This is the repository for the NDSS 2026 work ["Decompiling the Synergy: An Empirical Study of Human–LLM Teaming in Software Reverse Engineering"](https://www.zionbasque.com/files/papers/dec-synergy-study.pdf).
All code found in this repo can be used to reconstruct the study infrastructure or play-test the challenges used in the study. 

If you are only looking for the LLM tool (and decompiler instrumentation), you can find a working version at [mahaloz/DAILA](https://github.com/mahaloz/DAILA).

## Artifacts
- infrastructure: code for running our custom pwncollege Dojo, includes modified DAILA plugin.
- challenges: the two CTF challenges (and their code) found in our study
